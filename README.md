# Reverb-Demo
This is a virtual reality rhythm shooter game built for SteamVR systems that I developed as my senior project at school. It is designed to dynamically generate levels to the user's MP3 or WAV files. Unfortunately due to COVID-19 I had to leave campus (and the technology I was using to make it) before I could add a virtual reality UI, so it just has a simple desktop UI for the time being.

## How to Play (Same Instructions as Main Menu)
1. Press Select File, choose an MP3 or WAV file, then press Open
2. Once the file is completely loaded, Analyze will appear, press this if you are satisfied with your choice (Can take 10-15 seconds if first time playing song)
3. Put on the HMD and get ready to play
4. When analysis is finished, Play will appear, press this and the game will start in 15 seconds
5. As targets start to move with the song, shoot the pink ones with the right gun and the blue ones with the left gun
6. When the song is over, the game will wait 15 seconds and then return to this menu (remember to take off HMD and return to PC)
